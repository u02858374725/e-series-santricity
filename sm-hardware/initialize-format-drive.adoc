[.lead]
If you move assigned drives from one storage array to another, you must initialize (format) the drives before they can be used in the new storage array.

== About this task

Initializing removes the previous configuration information from a drive and returns it to the Unassigned state. The drive is then available for adding to a new pool or volume group in the new storage array.

Use the initialize drive operation when you are moving a single drive. You do not need to initialize drives if you are moving an entire volume group from one storage array to another.

[NOTE]
====
*Possible loss of data* -- When you initialize a drive, all data on the drive is lost. Perform this operation only when instructed to do so by technical support.
