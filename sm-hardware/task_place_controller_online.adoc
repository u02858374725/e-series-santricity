[.lead]
If a controller is in the offline state or in service mode, you can place it back online.

== Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click *Show back of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click a controller that is in either the offline state or service mode.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Place online*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

== Results

Detection of a restored preferred path by the multipath driver can take up to 10 minutes.

Any volumes originally owned by this controller are automatically moved back to the controller as I/O requests are received for each volume. In some cases, you might need to manually redistribute the volumes with the *Redistribute volumes* command.
