By enabling remote login, you allow users from outside the local area network to start an SSH session and access settings on the controller.

For SANtricity versions 11.74 and later, you can also configure multifactor authorization (MFA) by requiring users to enter an SSH key and/or SSH password. For SANtricity versions 11.73 and earlier, this feature does _not_ include an option for multifactor authorization with SSH keys and passwords.

[CAUTION]

*Security risk* -- For security reasons, only technical support personnel should use the Remote Login feature.

.Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click *Show back of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click the controller for which you want to configure remote login.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Configure remote login (SSH)*. (For SANtricity versions 11.73 and earlier, this menu item is *Change remote login*.)
+
The dialog box opens for enabling remote login.

. Select the *Enable remote login* checkbox.
+
This setting provides remote login with three options for authorization:

* *Password only*. For this option, you are done and can click *Save*. If you have a duplex system, you can enable remote login on the second controller by following the previous steps.
* *Either SSH key or password*. For this option, proceed to the next step.
* *Both password and SSH key*. For this option, select the *Require authorized public key and password for remote login* checkbox and proceed to the next step.

. Populate the *Authorized public key* field. This field contains a list of authorized public keys, in the format of the OpenSSH *authorized_keys* file.
+
When populating the *Authorized public key* field, be aware of the following guidelines:

 * The *Authorized public key* field applies to both controllers and only needs to be configured on the first controller.
 * The *authorized_keys* file should contain only one key per line. Lines starting with # and empty lines are ignored. For more information about the file format, see link:https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/authorized-keys-openssh[Configuring Authorized Keys for OpenSSH^].
 * An *authorized_keys* file should look similar to the following example:

. When you're done, click *Save*.

. For duplex systems, you can enable remote login on the second controller by following the steps above. If you are configuring the option for both a password and SSH key, be sure to select the *Require authorized public key and password for remote login* checkbox again.

. After technical support is finished troubleshooting, you can disable remote login by returning to the Configure Remote Login dialog box and de-selecting the *Enable remote login* checkbox. If remote login is enabled on a second controller, a confirmation dialog opens and allows you to disable remote login on the second one as well.
+
Disabling remote login terminates any current SSH sessions and rejects any new login requests.
