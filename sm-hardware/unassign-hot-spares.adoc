[.lead]
You can change a hot spare back to an unassigned drive.

== Before you begin

The hot spare must be in Optimal, Standby status.

== About this task

You cannot unassign a hot spare that is currently taking over for a failed drive. If the hot spare is not in Optimal status, follow the Recovery Guru procedures to correct any problems before trying to unassign the drive.

== Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the controllers, click *Show front of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the drives instead of the controllers.

. Select the hot spare drive (displayed in pink) that you want to unassign.
+
If there are diagonal lines through the pink drive bay, the hot spare is currently in use and cannot be unassigned.
+
The drive's context menu opens.

. From the drive's drop-down list, select *Unassign hot spare*.
+
The dialog box shows any volume groups affected by removing this hot spare and if any other hot spares are protecting them.

. Confirm the unassign operation.

== Results

The drive is returned to Unassigned (shown in gray).
