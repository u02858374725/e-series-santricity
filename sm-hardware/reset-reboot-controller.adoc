Some issues require a controller reset (reboot). You can reset the controller even if you don't have physical access to it.

.Before you begin

* The storage array must have two controllers. The controller that you are not resetting must be online (in the optimal state).
* Make sure that no volumes are in use or that you have a multipath driver installed on all hosts using these volumes.

.Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click *Show back of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click the controller that you want to reset.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Reset*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.
