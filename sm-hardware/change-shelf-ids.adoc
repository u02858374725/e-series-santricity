The shelf ID is a number that uniquely identifies a shelf in the storage array. Shelves are numbered consecutively, beginning with either 00 or 01, on the top left of each shelf view.

== About this task

The controller firmware automatically assigns the shelf ID, but you can change that number if you want to create a different ordering scheme.

== Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. Select the drop-down list for the Controller Shelf or Drive Shelf, and then select *Change ID*.
. In the *Change Shelf ID* dialog box, select the drop-down list to display available numbers.
+
This dialog box does not display IDs currently assigned to active shelves.

. Select an available number, and then click *Save*.
+
Depending on the number you selected, the shelf order may be rearranged on the Hardware page. If desired, you can use the up/down arrows on the top right of each shelf to readjust the order.
