[.lead]
If you are instructed to do so, you can place a controller offline.

== Before you begin

* Your storage array must have two controllers. The controller that you are not placing offline must be online (in the optimal state).
* Make sure that no volumes are in use or that you have a multipath driver installed on all hosts using these volumes.

== About this task

[NOTE]
====
Do not place a controller offline unless you are instructed to do so by the Recovery Guru or technical support.
====

== Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click *Show back of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Click the controller that you want to place offline.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Place offline*, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

== Results

It might take several minutes for System Manager to update the controller's status to offline. Do not begin any other operations until after the status has been updated.
