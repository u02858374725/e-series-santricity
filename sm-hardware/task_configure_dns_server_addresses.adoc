[.lead]
Domain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve fully qualified domain names for the controllers and a Network Time Protocol (NTP) server. The management ports on the storage array can support IPv4 or IPv6 protocols simultaneously.

== Before you begin

* A DNS server must be installed and configured in your network.
* You know the address of the primary DNS server and an optional backup DNS server. These addresses can be IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.

== About this task

This procedure describes how to specify a primary and backup DNS server address. The backup DNS server can be optionally configured to use if a primary DNS server fails.

[NOTE]
====
If you already configured the storage array's management ports with Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), and you have one or more DNS or NTP servers associated with the DHCP setup, then you do not need to manually configure DNS or NTP. In this case, the storage array should have already obtained the DNS/NTP server addresses automatically. However, you should still follow the instructions below to open the dialog box and make sure that the correct addresses are detected.
====

== Steps

. Select *Hardware*.
. If the graphic shows the drives, click *Show back of shelf*.
+
The graphic changes to show the controllers instead of the drives.

. Select the controller to configure.
+
The controller's context menu appears.

. Select *Configure DNS server*.
+
The Configure Domain Name System (DNS) Server dialog box opens.

. Select one of the following options:
 ** *Automatically obtain DNS server addresses from DHCP server* -- The detected DNS server addresses are shown.
+
[NOTE]
====
If the storage array is set to use a static DNS address, no DNS servers appear.
====

 ** *Manually specify DNS server addresses* -- Enter a primary DNS server address and a backup DNS server address. The backup server is optional. (These address fields appear after you select the radio button.) These addresses can be IPv4 addresses or IPv6 addresses.
. Click *Save*.
. Repeat these steps for the other controller.

== Results

The DNS configuration is displayed in the controller settings, DNS / NTP tab.
