You can view drive reconstruction status from the Operations in Progress dashboard.

From the *Home* page, click the *View Operations in Progress* link in the upper right.

Depending on the drive, the full reconstruction might take a considerable amount of time. If a volume ownership has changed, a full reconstruction might take place instead of the rapid reconstruction.
