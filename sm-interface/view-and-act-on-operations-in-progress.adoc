.About this task

For each operation listed on the Operations in Progress page, a percentage of completion and estimated time remaining to complete the operation are shown. In some cases, you can stop an operation or place it at a higher or lower priority. You can also clear a completed Volume Copy operation from the list.

.Steps

. On the Home page, select *Show operations in progress*.
+
The Operations in Progress page appears.

. If desired, use the links in the Actions column to stop or change priority for an operation.
+
[CAUTION]
====
Read all cautionary text provided in the dialog boxes, particularly when stopping an operation.
====
+
You can stop a volume copy operation or change its priority.

. Once a volume copy operation is complete, you can select *Clear* to remove it from the list.
+
At the top of the Home page, an informational message and yellow wrench icon appear when an operation is complete. This message includes a link that allows you to clear the operation from the Operations in Progress page.
