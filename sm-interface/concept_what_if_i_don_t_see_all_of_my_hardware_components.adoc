If you do not see all your hardware components on the Verify hardware dialog box, it could mean that a drive shelf is not connected correctly, or that an incompatible shelf is installed in the storage array.

Verify that all drive shelves are connected correctly. If you are uncertain about which drive shelves are compatible, contact technical support.
