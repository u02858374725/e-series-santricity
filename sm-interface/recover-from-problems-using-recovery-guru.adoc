The Recovery Guru is a component of System Manager that diagnoses storage array problems and recommends recovery procedures to fix the problems.

== Steps

. Select *Home*.
. Click the link labeled *Recover from `n` problems* in the center-top of the window.
+
The Recovery Guru dialog appears.

. Select the first problem shown in the summary list, and then follow the instructions in the recovery procedure to correct the problem. Where necessary, use the replacement instructions to replace failed components. Repeat this step for each listed problem.
+
Multiple problems within a storage array can be related. In this case, the order in which the problems are corrected can affect the outcome. Select and correct the problems in the order that they are listed in the summary list.
+
Multiple failures for a power-supply canister are grouped and listed as one problem in the summary list. Multiple failures for a fan canister are also listed as one problem.

. To make sure that the recovery procedure was successful, click *Recheck*.
+
If you selected a problem for an asynchronous mirror group or a member of an asynchronous mirror group, click *Clear* first to clear the fault from the controller, and then click *Recheck* to remove the event from the Recovery Guru.
+
If all of the problems have been corrected, the storage array icon eventually transitions from Needs Attention to Optimal. For some problems, a Fixing icon appears while an operation, such as reconstruction, is in progress.

. To save the Recovery Guru information to a file, click the *Save* icon.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser with the name `recovery-guru-failure-yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-mmm.html`.

. To print the Recovery Guru information, click the *Print* icon.
