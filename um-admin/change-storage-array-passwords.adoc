You can update the passwords used for viewing and accessing storage arrays in SANtricity Unified Manager.

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Storage admin permissions.
* You must know the current password for the storage array, which is set in SANtricity System Manager.

== About this task

In this task, you enter the current password for a storage array so you can access it in Unified Manager. This might be necessary if the array password was changed in System Manager and now it must also be changed in Unified Manager.

== Steps

. From the *Manage* page, select one or more storage arrays.
. Select *Uncommon Tasks* > *Provide Storage Array Passwords*.
. Enter the password or passwords for each storage array, and then click *Save*.
