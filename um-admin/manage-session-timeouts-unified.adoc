You can configure timeouts for Unified Manager, so that users inactive sessions are disconnected after a specified time.

.About this task

By default, the session timeout for Unified Manager is 30 minutes. You can adjust that time or you can disable session timeouts altogether.

NOTE: If Access Management is configured using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) capabilities embedded in the array, a session timeout might occur when the user’s SSO session reaches its maximum limit. This might occur before the System Manager session timeout.

.Steps

. From the menu bar, select the drop-down arrow next to your user login name.
. Select *Enable/Disable session timeout*.
+
The Enable/Disable Session Timeout dialog box opens.

. Use the spinner controls to increase or decrease the time in minutes.
+
The minimum timeout you can set is 15 minutes.
+
[NOTE]
====
To disable session timeouts, clear the *Set the length of time...* checkbox.

. Click *Save*.
