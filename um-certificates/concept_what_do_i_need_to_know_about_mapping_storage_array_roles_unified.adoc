Before mapping groups to roles, review the guidelines.

The RBAC (role-based access control) capabilities include the following roles:

* *Storage admin* -- Full read/write access to storage objects on the arrays, but no access to the security configuration.
* *Security admin* -- Access to the security configuration in Access Management and Certificate Management.
* *Support admin* -- Access to all hardware resources on storage arrays, failure data, and MEL events. No access to storage objects or the security configuration.
* *Monitor* -- Read-only access to all storage objects, but no access to the security configuration.

[NOTE]
====
The Monitor role is required for all users, including the administrator.
====

If you are using an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server and Directory Services, make sure that:

* An administrator has defined user groups in the directory service.
* You know the group domain names for the LDAP user groups.
