You can change the preferred controller ownership of a volume, so that I/O for host applications is directed through the new path.

== Before you begin

If you do not use a multipath driver, any host applications that are currently using the volume must be shut down. This action prevents application errors when the I/O path changes.

== About this task

You can change controller ownership for one or more volumes in a pool or volume group.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Volumes*.
. Select any volume, and then select *More* > *Change ownership*.
+
The Change Volume Ownership dialog box appears. All volumes on the storage array appear in this dialog box.

. Use the *Preferred Owner* drop-down list to change the preferred controller for each volume that you want to change, and confirm that you want to perform the operation.

== Results

* System Manager changes the controller ownership of the volume. I/O to the volume is now directed through this I/O path.
* The volume might not use the new I/O path until the multipath driver reconfigures to recognize the new path. This action usually takes less than five minutes.
