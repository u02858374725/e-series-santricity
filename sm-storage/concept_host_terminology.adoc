Learn how the host terms apply to your storage array.

|===
| Component| Definition
a|
Host
a|
A host is a server that sends I/O to a volume on a storage array.

a|
Host name
a|
The host name should equate to the system name of the host.

a|
Host cluster
a|
A host cluster is a group of hosts. You create a host cluster to make it easy to assign the same volumes to multiple hosts.

a|
Host interface protocol
a|
A host interface protocol is the connection (such as Fibre Channel, iSCSI, etc.) between the controllers and the hosts.

a|
HBA or Network Interface Card (NIC)
a|
A host bus adapter (HBA) is a board that resides in a host and contains one or more host ports.

a|
Host port
a|
A host port is a port on a host bus adapter (HBA) that provides the physical connection to a controller and is used for I/O operations.

a|
Host port identifier
a|
A host port identifier is a unique world-wide name associated with each host port on a host bus adapter (HBA).

* Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) host port identifiers must have between 1 and 233 characters. iSCSI host port identifiers display in standard IQN format (e.g., `iqn.xxx.com.xxx:8b3ad`).
* Non-iSCSI host port identifiers such as Fibre Channel and Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) display as colon-delimited after every two characters (e.g., `xx:yy:zz`). Fibre Channel host port identifiers must have 16 characters.

a|
Host operating system type
a|
The host operating system type is a configuration setting that defines how the controllers in the storage array react to I/O depending on the operating system (or variant) of the host. This is also sometimes called _host type_ for short.

a|
Controller host port
a|
A controller host port is a port on the controller that provides the physical connection to a host and is used for I/O operations.

a|
LUN
a|
A logical unit number (LUN) is the number assigned to the address space that a host uses to access a volume. The volume is presented to the host as capacity in the form of a LUN.

Each host has its own LUN address space. Therefore, the same LUN can be used by different hosts to access different volumes.
