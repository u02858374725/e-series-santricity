For a snapshot schedule, you can change automatic collection times or the frequency of collection.

== About this task

You can import settings from an existing snapshot schedule, or you can modify settings as needed.

Because a snapshot schedule is associated to a snapshot group or snapshot consistency group, reserved capacity might be affected by changes to schedule settings.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Snapshots*.
. Click the *Schedules* tab.
. Select the snapshot schedule that you want to change, and then click *Edit*.
+
The Edit Snapshot Schedule dialog box appears.

. Do one of the following:
 ** *Use a previously defined schedule from another snapshot object* -- Click *Import Schedule*, select the object with the schedule you want to import, and then click *Import*.
 ** *Edit the schedule settings* -- Refer to Field Details below.
