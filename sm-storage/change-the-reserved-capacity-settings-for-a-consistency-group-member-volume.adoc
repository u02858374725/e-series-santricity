Alert me when...
a|
    Use the spinner box to adjust the percentage point at which System Manager sends an alert notification when the reserved capacity for a member volume is nearing full.
+
When the reserved capacity for the member volume exceeds the specified threshold, System Manager sends an alert, allowing you time to increase reserved capacity or to delete unnecessary objects.
+
[NOTE]
====
Changing the Alert setting for one member volume will change it for _all_ member volumes that belong to the same consistency group.

Policy for full reserved capacity
a|
    You can choose one of the following policies:

 ** *Purge oldest snapshot image* -- System Manager automatically purges the oldest snapshot image in the consistency group, which releases the member's reserved capacity for reuse within the group.
 ** *Reject writes to base volume* -- When the reserved capacity reaches its maximum defined percentage, System Manager rejects any I/O write request to the base volume that triggered the reserved capacity access.

. Click *Save* to apply your changes.

== Results

System Manager changes the reserved capacity settings for the member volume, as well as the reserved capacity settings for all member volumes in the consistency group.
