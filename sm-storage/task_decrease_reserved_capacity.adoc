You use the Decrease Capacity option to decrease the reserved capacity for the following storage objects: snapshot group, snapshot volume, and consistency group member volume. You can decrease reserved capacity only by the amount(s) you used to increase it.

== Before you begin

* The storage object must contain more than one reserved capacity volume.
* The storage object must not be a mirrored pair volume.
* If the storage object is a snapshot volume, then it must be a disabled snapshot volume.
* If the storage object is a snapshot group, then it must not contain any associated snapshot images.

== About this task

Review the following guidelines:

* You can remove reserved capacity volumes only in the reverse order that they were added.
* You cannot decrease the reserved capacity for a snapshot volume that is read-only because it does not have any associated reserved capacity. Only snapshot volumes that are read-write require reserved capacity.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Pools & Volume Groups*.
. Click the *Reserved Capacity* tab.
. Select the storage object for which you want to decrease reserved capacity, and then click *Decrease Capacity*.
+
The Decrease Reserved Capacity dialog box appears.

. Select the capacity amount by which you want to decrease reserved capacity, and then click *Decrease*.

== Results

System Manager performs the following actions:

* Updates the capacity for the storage object.
* Displays the newly updated reserved capacity for the storage object.
* When you decrease capacity for a snapshot volume, System Manager automatically transitions the snapshot volume to a Disabled state. Disabled means that the snapshot volume is not currently associated with a snapshot image, and therefore, cannot be assigned to a host for I/O.
