You can disable a snapshot volume or a snapshot volume in a snapshot consistency group when you no longer need it or want to temporarily stop using it.

.About this task

Use the Disable option if one of these conditions applies:

* You are finished with the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume for the time being.
* You intend to re-create the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume (that is designated as read-write) at a later time and want to retain the associated reserved capacity so you do not need to create it again.
* You want to increase the storage array performance by stopping write activity to a read-write snapshot volume.

If the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume is designated as read-write, this option also lets you stop any further write activity to its associated reserved capacity volume. If you decide to re-create the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume, you must choose a snapshot image from the same base volume.

[NOTE]
====
If the snapshot volume or snapshot consistency group snapshot volume is part of an online copy relationship, you cannot perform the Disable option on the volume.

.Steps

. Select menu:Storage[Snapshots].
. Select the *Snapshot Volumes* tab.
+
System Manager displays all the snapshot volumes associated with the storage array.

. Select the snapshot volume that you want to disable, and then select menu:Uncommon Tasks[Disable].
. Confirm that you want to perform the operation, and then click *Disable*.

.Results

* The snapshot volume remains associated with its base volume.
* The snapshot volume retains its World Wide Name (WWN).
* If read-write, the snapshot volume retains its associated reserved capacity.
* The snapshot volume retains any host assignments and access. However, read-write requests fail.
* The snapshot volume loses its association with its snapshot image.
