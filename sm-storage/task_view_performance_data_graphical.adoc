You can view graphical performance data for logical objects, physical objects, applications, and workloads.

== About this task

The performance graphs show historical data as well as live data currently being captured. A vertical line on the graph, labeled Live updating, distinguishes historical data from live data.

*Home page view*

The Home page contains a graph showing storage array level performance. You can select limited metrics from this view, or you can click *View Performance Details* to select all the available metrics.

*Detailed view*

The graphs available from the detailed performance view are arranged under three tabs:

* *Logical View* -- Displays performance data for logical objects grouped by volume groups and pools. Logical objects include volume groups, pools, and volumes.
* *Physical View* -- Displays performance data for the controller, host channels, drive channels, and drives.
* *Applications & Workloads View* -- Displays a list of logical objects (volumes) grouped by the application types and workloads you have defined.

== Steps

. Select *Home*.
. To select an array-level view, click the IOPS, MiB/s, or CPU button.
. To see more details, click *View Performance Details*.
. Select *Logical View* tab, *Physical View* tab, or *Applications & Workloads View* tab.
+
Depending on the object type, different graphs appear in each tab.

| Options for viewing objects| Description
a|
    Expand a drawer to see the list of objects.
a|
    _Navigation drawers_ contain storage objects, such as pools, volume groups, and drives.
+
Click the drawer to view the list of objects in the drawer.
a|
    Select objects to view.
a|
    Select the check box to the left of each object to choose the performance data you want to view.
a|
    Use Filter to find object names or partial names.
a|
    In the Filter box, enter the name or a partial name of objects to list just those objects in the drawer.
a|
    Click *Refresh Graphs* after selecting objects.
a|
After selecting objects from the drawers, select *Refresh Graphs* to view graphical data for the items you have selected.
a|
    Hide or show graph
a|

Loading performance data for a 30-day time frame can take several minutes. Do not navigate away from the web page, refresh the web page, or close the browser while data is loading.
a|
    Data point details
a|
    Hover the cursor over the graph to see metrics for a particular data point.
a|
    Scroll bar
a|
    Use the scroll bar below the graph to view an earlier or later time span.
a|
    Zoom bar
a|
    Below the graph, drag the zoom bar handles to zoom out on a time span. The wider the zoom bar, the less granular the details of the graph.
+
To reset the graph, select one of the time frame options.
a|
    Drag and drop
a|
    On the graph, drag the cursor from one point in time to another to zoom in on a time span.
