Snapshot image

You can view the snapshot images associated with the snapshot volume. A snapshot image is a logical copy of volume data, captured at a particular point-in-time. Like a restore point, snapshot images allow you to roll back to a known good data set. Although the host can access the snapshot image, it cannot directly read or write to it.
a|
Base volume
a|
You can view the base volume associated with the snapshot volume. A base volume is the source from which a snapshot image is created. It can be a thick or thin volume and is typically assigned to a host. The base volume can reside in either a volume group or disk pool.
a|
Snapshot group
a|
You can view the snapshot group associated with the snapshot volume. A snapshot group is a collection of snapshot images from a single base volume.
