Any pool or volume group to which you cannot move the volume does not display in the list.

Pools or volume groups are not eligible for any of the following reasons:

* The Data Assurance (DA) capabilities of a pool or volume group pool do not match.
* A pool or volume group is in a non-optimal state.
* The capacity of a pool or volume group is too small.
