[.lead]
You can add a new member volume to an existing snapshot consistency group. When you add a new member volume, you also must reserve capacity for the member volume.

== Before you begin

* The member volume must be Optimal.
* The snapshot consistency group must have less than the maximum number of allowable volumes (as defined by your configuration).
* Each reserved capacity volume must have the same Data Assurance (DA) and security settings as the associated member volume.

== About this task

You can add standard volumes or thin volumes to the snapshot consistency group. The base volume can reside in either a pool or volume group.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Snapshots*.
. Select the *Snapshot Consistency Groups* tab.
+
The table appears and displays all the snapshot consistency groups associated with the storage array.

. Select the snapshot consistency group you want to modify, and then click *Add Members*.
+
The Add Members dialog box appears.

. Select the member volume(s) you want to add, and then click *Next*.
+
The Reserve Capacity step appears. The Volume Candidate table displays only the candidates that support the reserved capacity specified.

. Use the spinner box to allocate the reserved capacity for the member volume. Do one of the following actions:
 ** *Accept the default settings.*
+
Use this recommended option to allocate the reserved capacity for the member volume with the default settings.

 ** *Allocate your own reserved capacity settings to meet your data storage needs.*
+
If you change the default reserved capacity setting, click *Refresh Candidates* to refresh the candidate list for the reserved capacity you specified.
+
Allocate the reserved capacity using the following guidelines.

  *** The default setting for reserved capacity is 40% of the capacity of the base volume, and usually this capacity is sufficient.
  *** The capacity needed varies, depending on the frequency and size of I/O writes to the volumes and the quantity and duration of snapshot image collection.
. Click *Finish* to add the member volumes.
