You can change the settings for a snapshot group to change its name, auto-delete settings, the maximum number of allowed snapshot images, the percentage point at which System Manager sends a reserved capacity alert notification, or the policy to use when the reserved capacity reaches its maximum defined percentage.

== Before you begin

During the creation of a snapshot group, reserved capacity is created to store the data for all the snapshot images contained in the group.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Pools & Volume Groups*.
. Click the *Reserved Capacity* tab.
. Select the snapshot group that you want to edit, and then click *View/Edit Settings*.
+
The Snapshot Group Settings dialog box appears.

. Change the settings for the snapshot group as appropriate.

|===
| Setting| Description
a|
*Snapshot group settings*
a|
Name
a|
The name of the snapshot group. Specifying a name for the snapshot group is required.
a|
Auto-deletion
a|
A setting that keeps the total number of snapshot images in the group at or below a user-defined maximum. When this option is enabled, System Manager automatically deletes the oldest snapshot image in the group any time a new snapshot is created, to comply with the maximum number of snapshot images allowed for the group.
a|
Snapshot image limit
a|
A configurable value that specifies the maximum number of snapshot images allowed for a snapshot group.
a|
Snapshot schedule
a|
If Yes, a schedule is set for automatically creating snapshots.
a|
*Reserved capacity settings*
a|
Alert me when...
a|
    Use the spinner box to adjust the percentage point at which System Manager sends an alert notification when the reserved capacity for a snapshot group is nearing full.
+
When the reserved capacity for the snapshot group exceeds the specified threshold, System Manager sends an alert, allowing you time to increase reserved capacity or to delete unnecessary objects.
a|
Policy for full reserved capacity
a|
    You can choose one of the following policies:

 ** *Purge oldest snapshot image* -- System Manager automatically purges the oldest snapshot image in the snapshot group, which releases the snapshot image reserved capacity for reuse within the group.
 ** *Reject writes to base volume* -- When the reserved capacity reaches its maximum defined percentage, System Manager rejects any I/O write request to the base volume that triggered the reserved capacity access.

a|
*Associated objects*
a|
Base volume
a|
The name of the base volume used for the group. A base volume is the source from which a snapshot image is created. It can be a thick or thin volume and is typically assigned to a host. The base volume can reside in either a volume group or disk pool.
a|
Snapshot images
a|
The number of images created from this group. A snapshot image is a logical copy of volume data, captured at a particular point-in-time. Like a restore point, snapshot images allow you to roll back to a known good data set. Although the host can access the snapshot image, it cannot directly read or write to it.
