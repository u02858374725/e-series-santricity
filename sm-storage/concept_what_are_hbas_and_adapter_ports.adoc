A host bus adapter (HBA) is a board that resides in a host and contains one or more host ports. A host port is a port on a host bus adapter (HBA) that provides the physical connection to a controller and is used for I/O operations.

The adapter ports on the HBA are called host ports. Most HBAs have either one or two host ports. The HBA has a unique World Wide Identifier (WWID), and each HBA host port has a unique WWID. The host port identifiers are used to associate the appropriate HBA with the physical host when you are either manually creating the host through SANtricity System Manager or automatically creating the host using the host context agent.
