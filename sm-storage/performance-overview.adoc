The Performance page provides graphs and tables of data that enable you to assess the storage array's performance in several key areas.

Performance functions allow you to accomplish these tasks:

* View performance data in near real-time to help you determine whether a storage array is experiencing problems.
* Export performance data to construct a historical view of a storage array and identify when a problem started or what caused a problem.
* Select the objects, performance metrics, and time frame you want to view.
* Compare metrics.

You can view performance data in three formats:

* *Real-time graphical* -- Plots performance data on a graph in near real-time.
* *Near real-time tabular* -- Lists performance data in a table in near real-time.
* *Exported CSV file* -- Allows you to save tabular performance data in a file of comma-separated values for further viewing and analysis.

== Guidelines for viewing performance data

* Performance data collection is always on. There is no option to turn it off.
* Each time the sampling interval elapses, the storage array is queried and the data is updated.
* For graphical data, the 5-minute time frame supports 10-second updating averaged over 5 minutes. All other time frames are updated every 5 minutes, averaged over the selected time frame.
* Performance data in the graphical views is updated in real time. Performance data in the table view is updated in near real time.
* If a monitored object changes during the time data is collected, the object might not have a complete set of data points spanning the selected time frame. For example, volume sets can change as volumes are created, deleted, assigned, or unassigned; or drives can be added, removed, or failed.
