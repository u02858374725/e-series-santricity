If you set up Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) authentication on any iSCSI host connected to the storage array, you must re-enter that initiator CHAP secret for each iSCSI host. To do this, you can use System Manager either as part of the Create Host operation or through the View/Edit Settings option.

If you are using CHAP mutual authentication, you also must define a target CHAP secret for the storage array in the Settings page and re-enter that target CHAP secret on each iSCSI host.
