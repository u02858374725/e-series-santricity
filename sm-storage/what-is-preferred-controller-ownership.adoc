Preferred controller ownership defines the controller that is designated to be the owning, or primary, controller of the volume.

Controller ownership is very important and should be planned carefully. Controllers should be balanced as closely as possible for total I/Os.

For example, if one controller reads primarily large, sequential data blocks and the other controller has small data blocks with frequent reads and writes, the loads are very different. Knowing which volumes contain what type of data allows you to balance I/O transfers equally over both controllers.
