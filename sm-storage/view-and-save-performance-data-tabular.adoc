+
You can click each check box to select or deselect an item.

. Select *Export* at the bottom of the screen to save the tabular view to a file of comma-separated values (CSV).
+
The *Export Table* dialog box appears, indicating the number of rows to be exported and the file format of the export (comma-separated values, or CSV format).

. Click *Export* to proceed with the download, or click *Cancel*.
+
Depending on your browser settings, the file is either saved, or you are prompted to choose a name and location for the file.
