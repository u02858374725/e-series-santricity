The Latency graph provides latency statistics, in milliseconds (ms), for volumes, volume groups, pools, applications, and workloads. This graph appears in the Logical View, Physical View, and Applications & Workloads View tabs.

Latency refers to any delay that occurs as data is read or written. Hover your cursor over a point on the graph to view the following values, in milliseconds (ms), for that point in time:

* Read time.
* Write time.
* Average I/O size.
