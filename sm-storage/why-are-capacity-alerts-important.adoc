Capacity alerts indicate when to add drives to a pool. A pool needs sufficient free capacity to successfully perform storage array operations. You can prevent interruptions to these operations by configuring System Manager to send alerts when the free capacity of a pool reaches or exceeds a specified percentage.

You set this percentage when you create a pool using either the *Pool auto-configuration* option or the *Create pool* option. If you choose the automatic option, default settings automatically determine when you receive alert notifications. If you choose to manually create the pool, you can determine the alert notification settings; or if you prefer, you can accept the default settings. You can adjust these settings later in menu:Settings[Alerts].

[NOTE]
====
When the free capacity in the pool reaches the specified percentage, an alert notification is sent using the method you specified in the alert configuration.
