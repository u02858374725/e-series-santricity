You disable a snapshot volume when you want to assign a different snapshot volume to the snapshot image. You can reserve the disabled snapshot volume for later use.

If you no longer need the snapshot volume or the consistency group snapshot volume and do not intend to re-create it at a later time, you should delete the volume instead of disabling it.
