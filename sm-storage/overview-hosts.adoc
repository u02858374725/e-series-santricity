You can configure hosts and host clusters, which define the connections between the storage array and the data servers.

== What are hosts and host clusters?
A _host_ is a server that sends I/O to a volume on a storage array. A _host cluster_ is a group of hosts, which you can create for assigning the same volumes to multiple hosts.

== How do I configure hosts and host clusters?

To define host connections, you can either allow a Host Context Agent (HCA) to automatically detect the hosts or you can go to menu:Storage[Hosts] to manually configure the host. If you want two or more hosts to share access to the same set of volumes, you can then define a cluster and assign the volumes to that cluster.
