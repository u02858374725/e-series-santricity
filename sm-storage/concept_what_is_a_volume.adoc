A volume is a container in which applications, databases, and file systems store data. It is the logical component created for the host to access storage on the storage array.

A volume is created from the capacity available in a pool or a volume group. A volume has a defined capacity. Although a volume might consist of more than one drive, a volume appears as one logical component to the host.
