Technical support can use recovery support files to troubleshoot issues. System Manager automatically saves these files.

== About this task

Recovery support files include these types of files:

* Support data files
* AutoSupport history
* AutoSupport log
* SAS/RLS diagnostics files
* Recovery profile data
* Database capture files

== Steps

. Select *Support* > *Support Center* > *Diagnostics* tab.
. Select *Retrieve Recovery Support Files*.
+
A dialog box lists all the recovery support files that your storage array has collected. To find particular files, you can sort any of the columns or type characters in the *Filter* box.

. Select a file, and then click *Download*.
+
The file is saved in the Downloads folder for your browser.
