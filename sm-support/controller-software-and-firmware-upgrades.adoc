You can upgrade your storage array's software and firmware for all the latest features and bug fixes.

== Components included in the SANtricity OS controller software upgrade

Several storage array components contain software or hardware that you might want to upgrade occasionally.

* *Management software* -- System Manager is the software that manages the storage array.
* *Controller firmware* -- Controller firmware manages the I/O between hosts and volumes.
* *Controller NVSRAM* -- Controller NVSRAM is a controller file that specifies the default settings for the controllers.
* *IOM firmware* -- The I/O module (IOM) firmware manages the connection between a controller and a drive shelf. It also monitors the status of the components.
* *Supervisor software* -- Supervisor software is the virtual machine on a controller in which the software runs.

You can view your current software and firmware versions in the Software and Firmware Inventory dialog box. Go to menu:Support[Upgrade Center], and then click the link for *Software and Firmware Inventory*.

As part of the upgrade process, the host's multipath/failover driver and/or HBA driver might also need to be upgraded so the host can interact with the controllers correctly. To determine if this is the case, see the https://imt.netapp.com/matrix/#welcome[Netapp Interoperability Matrix Tool^].

== When to stop I/O

If your storage array contains two controllers and you have a multipath driver installed, the storage array can continue processing I/O while the upgrade occurs. During the upgrade, controller A fails over all of its volumes to controller B, upgrades, takes back its volumes and all of controller B's volumes, and then upgrades controller B.

== Pre-upgrade health check

A pre-upgrade health check runs as part of the upgrade process. The pre-upgrade health check assesses all storage array components to make sure the upgrade can proceed. The following conditions might prevent the upgrade:

* Failed assigned drives
* Hot spares in use
* Incomplete volume groups
* Exclusive operations running
* Missing volumes
* Controller in Non-optimal status
* Excess number of event log events
* Configuration database validation failure
* Drives with old versions of DACstore

You also can run the pre-upgrade health check separately without doing an upgrade.
