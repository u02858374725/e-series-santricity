Suspending IOM auto-synchronization prevents the IOM firmware from being upgraded the next time a SANtricity OS controller software upgrade occurs.

Normally, controller software and IOM firmware are upgraded as a bundle. You can suspend IOM auto-synchronization if you have a special build of IOM firmware that you want to preserve on your enclosure. Otherwise, you will revert to the IOM firmware bundled with the controller software the next time you do a controller software upgrade.
