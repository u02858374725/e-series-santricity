The AutoSupport log provides information about status, dispatch history, and errors encountered during the delivery of AutoSupport dispatches.

== About this task

Multiple log files can exist. When the current log file reaches 200 KB, it is archived and a new log file is created. The archived log file name is `ASUPMessages.``n`, where `n` is an integer from 1 to 9. If multiple log files exist, you can choose to view the most current log or a previous log.
