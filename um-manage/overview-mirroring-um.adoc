== What is mirroring?
SANtricity applications include two types of mirroring -- asynchronous and synchronous. Asynchronous mirroring copies data volumes on demand or on a schedule, which minimizes or avoids downtime that might result from data corruption or loss. Synchronous mirroring replicates data volumes in real time to ensure continuous availability.

== How do I configure mirroring?
You configure asynchronous or synchronous mirroring in Unified Manager, and then use System Manager to manage synchronizations.
