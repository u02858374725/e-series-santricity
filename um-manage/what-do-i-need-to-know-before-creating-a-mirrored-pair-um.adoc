[.lead]
Before creating a mirrored pair, follow these guidelines.

* You must have two storage arrays.
* Each storage array must have two controllers.
* The two storage arrays must be discovered in Unified Manager.
* Each controller in both the primary array and secondary array must have an Ethernet management port configured and must be connected to your network.
* The storage arrays have a minimum firmware version of 7.84. (They can each run different OS versions.)
* You must know the password for the local and remote storage arrays.
* You must have enough free capacity on the remote storage array to create a secondary volume equal to or greater than the primary volume that you want to mirror.
* Asynchronous mirroring is supported on controllers with Fibre Channel (FC) or iSCSI host ports, while synchronous mirroring is supported only on controllers with FC host ports.
