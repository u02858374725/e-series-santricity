During the Import Settings operation, some of your storage arrays might not be available in the target selection dialog box.

Storage arrays might not appear for the following reasons:

* The firmware version is below 8.50.
* The storage array is offline.
* The system cannot communicate with that array (for example, the array has certificate, password, or networking problems).
