The Asynchronous Mirroring feature provides a controller-level, firmware-based mechanism for data replication between a local storage array and a remote storage array.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is not available on the EF600 or EF300 storage system.

== What is asynchronous mirroring?
_Asynchronous mirroring_ captures the state of the primary volume at a particular point in time and copies just the data that has changed since the last image capture. The primary site can be updated immediately and the secondary site can be updated as bandwidth allows. The information is cached and sent later, as network resources become available.

Asynchronous mirroring is created on a per-volume basis but managed at a group level, allowing you to associate a distinct remote mirrored volume with any primary volume on a given storage array. This type of mirroring is ideal for satisfying the demand for non-stop operations and, in general, is far more network efficient for periodic processes.

== How do I configure asynchronous mirroring?
You must use the Unified Manager interface to perform the initial mirroring configuration between the arrays. Once it is configured, you can manage mirrored pairs and consistency groups in System Manager.
