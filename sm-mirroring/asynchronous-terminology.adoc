Learn how the asynchronous mirroring terms apply to your storage array.

|===
| Term

| Description

a|
Local storage array

a|
The local storage array is the storage array that you are acting upon.

When you see *Primary* in the Local Role column, it indicates that the storage array contains the volume that holds the primary role in the mirror relationship. When you see *Secondary* in the Local Role column, it indicates that the storage array contains the volume that holds the secondary role in the mirror relationship.

a|
Mirror consistency group

a|
A mirror consistency group is a container for one or more mirrored pairs. For asynchronous mirroring operations, you must create a mirror consistency group.

a|
Mirrored pair

a|
A mirrored pair is comprised of two volumes, a primary volume and a secondary volume.

In asynchronous mirroring, a mirrored pair always belongs to a mirror consistency group. Write operations are performed first to the primary volume and then replicated to the secondary volume. Each mirrored pair in a mirror consistency group share the same synchronization settings.

a|
Primary volume

a|
The primary volume of a mirrored pair is the source volume to be mirrored.

a|
Remote storage array

a|
The remote storage array is usually designated as the secondary site, which usually holds a replica of the data in a mirroring configuration.

a|
Reserved capacity

a|
Reserved capacity is the physical allocated capacity that is used for any copy service operation and storage object. It is not directly readable by the host.

a|
Role change

a|
Role change is assigning the primary role to the secondary volume and vice versa.

a|
Secondary volume

a|
The secondary volume of a mirrored pair is usually located at a secondary site and holds a replica of the data.

a|
Synchronization

a|
Synchronization occurs at initial synchronization between the local storage array and the remote storage array. Synchronization also occurs when the primary and secondary volumes become unsynchronized after a communication interruption. When the communication link is working again, any unreplicated data is synchronized to the secondary volume's storage array.
