You can deactivate the Synchronous Mirroring feature on a storage array to re-establish normal use of host bus adapter (HBA) host port 4, which was reserved for mirror data transmission.

== Before you begin

You must have deleted all synchronous mirror relationships. Verify that all mirrored pairs have been deleted from the storage array.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Synchronous Mirroring*.
. Select *Uncommon Tasks* > *Deactivate*.
+
The system displays a confirmation.

. Select *Yes* to confirm.

== Results

* The controller's HBA host port 4, which was dedicated for synchronous mirroring communication, can now accept host read and write requests.
* The reserved capacity volumes on the storage array are deleted.
