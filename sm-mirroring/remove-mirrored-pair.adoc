[.lead]
You remove a mirrored pair to remove the mirror relationship from the primary volume on the local storage array and the secondary volume on the remote storage array.

== About this task

Review the following information about orphaned mirrored pairs:

* An orphaned mirrored pair exists when a member volume in a consistency mirror group has been removed on one side (either the local storage array side or the remote storage array side) but not on the other side.
* Orphaned mirrored pairs are detected when inter-array communication is restored and the two sides of the mirror configuration reconcile mirror parameters.
* You can remove a mirrored pair to correct an orphaned mirrored pair state.

== Steps

. Select *Storage* > *Asynchronous Mirroring*.
. Select the *Mirrored Pair* tab.
+
The Mirrored Pairs table appears and displays all the mirrored pairs associated with the storage array.

. Select the mirrored pair that you want to remove, and then click *Remove*.
. Confirm that you want to remove the mirrored pair, and then click *Remove*.

== Results

SANtricity System Manager performs the following actions:

* Removes the mirror relationship from the mirror consistency group on the local storage array and on the remote storage array, and deletes the reserved capacity.
* Returns the primary volume and the secondary volume to host-accessible, non-mirrored volumes.
* Updates the Asynchronous Mirroring tile with the removal of the asynchronous mirrored pair.
