Use the Clear Configuration operation when you want to delete all the pools, volume groups, volumes, host definitions, and host assignments from the storage array.

== Before you begin

* Before clearing the storage array configuration, back up the data.

== About this task

There are two Clear Storage Array Configuration options:

* *Volume* -- Typically, you might use the Volume option to reconfigure a test storage array as a production storage array. For example, you might configure a storage array for testing, and then, when you are done testing, remove the test configuration and set up the storage array for a production environment.
* *Storage Array* -- Typically, you might use the Storage Array option to move a storage array to another department or group. For example, you might be using a storage array in Engineering, and now Engineering is getting a new storage array, so you want to move the current storage array to Administration where it will be reconfigured.

The Storage Array option deletes some additional settings.

[NOTE]
====
*Risk of data loss* -- This operation deletes all data from your storage array. (It does not do a secure erase.) You cannot cancel this operation after it starts. Perform this operation only when instructed to do so by technical support.
====

== Steps

. Select *Settings* > *System*.
. Select *Clear Storage Array Configuration*.
. In the drop-down list, select either *Volume* or *Storage Array*.
. (Optional) If you want to save the configuration (not the data), use the links in the dialog box.
. Confirm that you want to perform the operation.

== Results

* The current configuration is deleted, destroying all existing data on the storage array.
* All drives are unassigned.
