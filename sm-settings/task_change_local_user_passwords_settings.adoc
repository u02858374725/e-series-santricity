You can set the minimum required length for all new or updated local user passwords on the storage array. You can also allow local users to access the storage array without entering a password.

== Before you begin

* You must be logged in as the local administrator, which includes Root admin permissions.

== About this task

Keep these guidelines in mind when setting the minimum length for local user passwords:

* Setting changes will not affect existing local user passwords.
* The minimum required length setting for local user passwords must be between 0 and 30 characters.
* Any new local user passwords must meet or exceed the current minimum length setting.
* Do not set a minimum length for the password if you want local users to access the storage array without entering a password.

== Steps

. Select *Settings* > *Access Management*.
. Select the *Local User Roles* tab.
. Select the *View/Edit Settings* button.
+
The Local User Password Settings dialog box opens.

. Do one of the following:
 ** To allow local users to access the storage array _without_ entering a password, uncheck the "Require all local user passwords to be at least" checkbox.
 ** To set a minimum password length for all local user passwords, check the "Require all local user passwords to be at least" checkbox and then use the spinner box to set the minimum required length for all local user passwords.
+
Any new local user passwords must meet or exceed the current setting.
. Click *Save*.
