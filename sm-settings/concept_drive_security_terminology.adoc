Learn how the Drive Security terms apply to your storage array.

|===
| Term| Description
a|
Drive Security feature
a|
Drive Security is a storage array feature that provides an extra layer of security with either Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives. When these drives are used with the Drive Security feature, they require a security key for access to their data. When the drives are physically removed from the array, they cannot operate until they are installed in another array, at which point, they will be in a Security Locked state until the correct security key is provided.
a|
FDE drives
a|
Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives perform encryption on the disk drive at the hardware level. The hard drive contains an ASIC chip that encrypts data during writes, and then decrypts data during reads.
a|
FIPS drives
a|
FIPS drives use Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2 level 2. They are essentially FDE drives that adhere to United States government standards for ensuring strong encryption algorithms and methods. FIPS drives have higher security standards than FDE drives.
a|
Management client
a|
A local system (computer, tablet, etc.) that includes a browser for accessing System Manager.
a|
Pass phrase
a|
The pass phrase is used to encrypt the security key for backup purposes. The same pass phrase used to encrypt the security key must be provided when the backed up security key is imported as the result of a drive migration or head swap. A pass phrase can have between 8 and 32 characters.
[NOTE]
====
The pass phrase for Drive Security is independent from the storage array's Administrator password.

a|
Secure-capable drives
a|
Secure-capable drives can be either Full Disk Encryption (FDE) drives or Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) drives, which encrypt data during writes and decrypt data during reads. These drives are considered secure-_capable_ because they can be used for additional security using the Drive Security feature. If the Drive Security feature is enabled for volume groups and pools used with these drives, the drives become secure-_enabled_.
a|
Secure-enabled drives
a|
Secure-enabled drives are used with the Drive Security feature. When you enable the Drive Security feature and then apply Drive Security to a pool or volume group on secure-_capable_ drives, the drives become secure__-enabled__. Read and write access is available only through a controller that is configured with the correct security key. This added security prevents unauthorized access to the data on a drive that is physically removed from the storage array.
a|
Security key
a|
A security key is a string of characters that is shared between the secure-enabled drives and controllers in a storage array. Whenever power to the drives is turned off and on, the secure-enabled drives change to a Security Locked state until the controller applies the security key. If a secure-enabled drive is removed from the storage array, the drive's data is locked. When the drive is re-installed in a different storage array, it looks for the security key before it makes the data accessible again. To unlock the data, you must apply the original security key. You can create and manage security keys using one of the following methods:

* Internal key management -- Create and maintain security keys on the controller's persistent memory.
* External key management -- Create and maintain security keys on an external key management server.

a|
Security key identifier
a|
The security key identifier is a string that is associated with the security key during key creation. The identifier is stored on the controller and on all drives associated with the security key.
