To break the connection between a directory server and the storage array, you can remove the server information from the Access Management page. You might want to perform this task if you configured a new server, and then want to remove the old one.

== Before you begin

* You must be logged in with a user profile that includes Security admin permissions. Otherwise, the Access Management functions do not appear.

== About this task

After you complete this task, any active user sessions are terminated. Only your current user session is retained.

== Steps

. Select *Settings* > *Access Management*.
. Select the *Directory Services* tab.
. From the list, select the directory server you want to delete.
. Click *Remove*.
+
The Remove Directory Server dialog box opens.

. Type `remove` in the field, and then click *Remove*.
+
The directory server configuration settings, privilege settings, and role mappings are removed. Users can no longer log in with credentials from this server.
