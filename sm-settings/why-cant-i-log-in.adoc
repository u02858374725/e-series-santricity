If you receive an error when attempting to log in to System Manager, review these possible causes.

Login errors to System Manager might occur for one of these reasons:

* You entered an incorrect username or password.
* You have insufficient privileges.
* The directory server (if configured) might be unavailable. If this is the case, try logging in with a local user role.
* You attempted to log in unsuccessfully multiple times, which triggered the lockout mode. Wait 10 minutes to re-login.
* A lockout condition was triggered and your audit log might be full. Go to Access Management and delete old events from the audit log.
* SAML authentication is enabled. Refresh your browser to log in.

Login errors to a remote storage array for mirroring tasks might occur for one of these reasons:

* You have entered an incorrect password.
* You attempted to log in unsuccessfully multiple times, which triggered the lockout mode. Wait 10 minutes to log in again.
* The maximum number of client connections used on the controller has been reached. Check for multiple users or clients.
