By viewing audit logs, users with Security Admin permissions can monitor user actions, authentication failures, invalid login attempts, and the user session lifespan.

== Before you begin

Audit log activity appears in tabular format, which includes the following columns of information:

 ** *Date/Time* -- Timestamp of when the storage array detected the event (in GMT).
 ** *Username* -- The user name associated with the event. For any non-authenticated actions on the storage array, "N/A" appears as the user name. Non-authenticated actions might be triggered by the internal proxy or some other mechanism.
 ** *Status Code* -- HTTP status code of the operation (200, 400, etc.) and descriptive text associated with the event.
 ** *URL Accessed* -- Full URL (including host) and query string.
 ** *Client IP Address* -- IP address of the client associated with the event.
 ** *Source* -- Logging source associated with the event, which can be System Manager, CLI, Web Services, or Support Shell.

. Use the selections on the Audit Log page to view and manage events.
