For Access Management, administrators can use an LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server and a directory service, such as Microsoft's Active Directory.

== Configuration workflow

If an LDAP server and directory service are used in the network, configuration works as follows:

. An administrator logs in to SANtricity System Manager with a user profile that includes Security Admin permissions.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `admin` user has full access to all functions in the system.
====

. The administrator enters the configuration settings for the LDAP server. Settings include the domain name, URL, and Bind account information.
. If the LDAP server uses a secure protocol (LDAPS), the administrator uploads a Certificate Authority (CA) certificate chain for authentication between the LDAP server and the storage array.
. After the server connection is established, the administrator maps the user groups to the storage array's roles. These roles are predefined and cannot be modified.
. The administrator tests the connection between the LDAP server and the storage array.
. Users log in to the system with their assigned LDAP/Directory Services credentials.

== Management

When using directory services for authentication, administrators can perform the following management tasks:

* Add a directory server.
* Edit directory server settings.
* Map LDAP users to local user roles.
* Remove a directory server.
