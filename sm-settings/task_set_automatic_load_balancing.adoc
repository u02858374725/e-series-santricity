The Automatic Load Balancing feature ensures that incoming I/O traffic from the hosts is dynamically managed and balanced across both controllers. This feature is enabled by default, but you can disable it from System Manager.

== About this task

When Automatic Load Balancing is enabled, it performs the following functions:

* Automatically monitors and balances controller resource utilization.
* Automatically adjusts volume controller ownership when needed, thereby optimizing I/O bandwidth between the hosts and the storage array.

You might want to disable Automatic Load Balancing on your storage array for the following reasons:

* You do not want to automatically change a particular volume's controller ownership to balance workload.
* You are operating in a highly tuned environment where load distribution is purposefully set up to achieve a specific distribution between the controllers.

== Steps

. Select *Settings* > *System*.
. Scroll down to *Additional Settings*, and then click *Enable/Disable Automatic Load Balancing*.
+
The text below this option indicates whether the feature is currently enabled or disabled.
+
A confirmation dialog opens.

. Confirm by clicking *Yes* to continue.
+
By selecting this option, you toggle the feature between enabled/disabled.

[NOTE]
====
If this feature is moved from disabled to enabled, the Host Connectivity Reporting feature is automatically enabled as well.
