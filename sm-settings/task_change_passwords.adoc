You can change the user passwords for each user profile in Access Management.

== Before you begin

* You must be logged in as the local administrator, which includes Root admin permissions.
* You must know the local administrator password.

== About this task

Keep these guidelines in mind when choosing a password:

* Any new local user passwords must meet or exceed the current setting for a minimum password (in View/Edit Settings).
* Passwords are case sensitive.
* Trailing spaces are not stripped from passwords when they are set. Be careful to include spaces if they were included in the password.
* For increased security, use at least 15 alphanumeric characters and change the password frequently.

[NOTE]
====
Changing the password in System Manager also changes it in the command line interface (CLI). In addition, password changes cause the user's active session to terminate.

== Steps

. Select *Settings* > *Access Management*.
. Select the *Local User Roles* tab.
. Select a user from the table.
+
The Change Password button becomes available.

. Select *Change Password*.
+
The Change Password dialog box opens.

. If no minimum password length is set for local user passwords, you can check the box to require the selected user to enter a password to access the storage array, and then you can type the new password for the selected user.
. Enter your local administrator password, and then click *Change*.

== Results

If the user is currently logged in, the password change causes the user's active session to terminate.
