The Drive Settings window includes information about the Drive Security attributes. "Read/Write Accessible" is one of the attributes that displays if a drive's data has been locked.

To view Drive Security attributes, go to the Hardware page. Select a drive, click *View settings*, and then click *Show more settings*. At the bottom of the page, the Read/Write Accessible attribute value is *Yes* when the drive is unlocked. The Read/Write Accessible attribute value is *No, invalid security key* when the drive is locked. You can unlock a secure drive by importing a security key (go to menu:Settings[System > Unlock Secure Drives]).
