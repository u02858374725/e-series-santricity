You can configure timeouts in SANtricity System Manager, so that users' inactive sessions are disconnected after a specified time.

== About this task

By default, the session timeout for System Manager is 30 minutes. You can adjust that time or you can disable session timeouts altogether.

[NOTE]
====
If Access Management is configured using the Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) capabilities embedded in the array, a session timeout might occur when the user's SSO session reaches its maximum limit. This might occur before the System Manager session timeout.
====

== Steps

. Select *Settings* > *System*.
. Under the *General* section, select *Enable/Disable Session Timeout*.
+
The Enable/Disable Session Timeout dialog box opens.

. Use the spinner controls to increase or decrease the time in minutes.
+
The minimum timeout you can set for System Manager is 15 minutes.
+
[NOTE]
====
To disable session timeouts, deselect the *Set the length of time...* checkbox.
====

. Click *Save*.
